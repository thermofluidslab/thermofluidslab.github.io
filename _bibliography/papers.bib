               manufacturing, the grinding and mixing of raw materials are
               critical because they form the most upstream process and directly
               influence product quality. However, this process significantly
               relies on empirical rules and the tacit knowledge of engineers,
               and a detailed understanding—particularly through slurry-mixing
               visualization and optimization—remaining largely unexplored.

              structure, their decomposition is thought to involve a lamellar
              structure collapse process. However, even in the simplest case of
              an order-disorder transition between lamellae and melt upon
              heating, the microscopic details of the transition have yet to be
              elucidated. In particular, it is unclear whether nucleation

              between the crystalline and amorphous portions. To observe the
